# Greenlight fork for customisation for HT webhub

Is a simple front-end interface for your BigBlueButton server. It provides a minimalistic web-based application that allows users to:

  * Signup/Login with Twitter, Google, or through the application itself.
  * Manage your account settings and user preferences.
  * Create and manage your own personal rooms ([BigBlueButton](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton) sessions).
  * Invite others to your room using a simple URL.
  * View recordings and share them with others.

It is also completely configurable. This means you can turn on/off features to make it fit your specific use case. For more information on Greenlight and its features, see our [documentation](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/install/greenlight-v2.html).

## Installation on a BigBlueButton Server

It is designed to work on a [BigBlueButton 2.0](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton) (or later) server.
